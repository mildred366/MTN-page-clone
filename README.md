# MTN-page-clone
This is just a sample project of my designs using basic html and css. 
This is my first try to build a frontend web page on designs only, this took me 4 days in total.
This clone is MTN NIN verification page that doesn't consists of any logic just the exact design.

## Description
It consists of 5 div sections, one that's the main container housing all other divs, then it has an empty div as in the design with a yellow background.
then a main wrapper div to house the form and all the labels and inputs.
